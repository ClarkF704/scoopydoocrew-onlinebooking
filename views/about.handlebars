            ScoopyDooCrew was founded with the goal to help Pet Owners enjoy a
            healthy environment outdoors with friends, family, and pets. Our
            purpose is to protect you, your pet, and loved ones from Pet Waste
            that can accumulate quickly and create toxicities in your grass,
            landscape, and SHOES.

            We are a Family Owned and Operated Small Business and understand the
            demands that pet ownership can place on their owners. Collectively,
            each employee of ScoopyDooCrew is a pet owner and has years of
            experience and enjoyment from their pet. Pets are family and we hope
            to earn your business and become part of yours.

          <p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif">
            We offer weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and one-time Pet Waste Removal
            Services. We are competitively priced, insured, bonded, and aim to
            provide outstanding Customer Service.

            ScoopyDooCrew will treat your yard and home with respect,
            pre-sanitizing our equipment and shoes before each Pet Waste Removal
            Service. We will collect the Pet Waste and remove it from your
            property and leave a Service Note after each visit. It will never be
            a “Mystery” for Home Owners about the Services we provided.
