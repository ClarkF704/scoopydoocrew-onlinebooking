                  That is a great question. We know that Pet Feces is not the
                  same as organic fertilizer. Cows eat plant matter. Dogs
                  specifically, have a more high in protein diet. Allowing dog
                  waste to accumulate can turn a beautiful, lush, green backyard
                  into an ugly, smelly mess. It may also pose a threat to your
                  children or grandchildren who would be at risk due to
                  contamination. Because Pet Feces is extremely high in nitrogen
                  and phosphorus, it can burn your yard with its acidity. An
                  unsanitary backyard can also become a breeding ground for
                  bacteria. The parasites and bacteria in dog feces can spread
                  disease to other dogs and even you if not properly picked up.
                  This harmful bacteria can also have the potential to affect
                  water quality. Dog waste can take up to 12 months to fully
                  break down. When rain water washes over dog poop, it flows
                  into the drainage system. This contaminated water goes
                  directly at times to lakes, streams, and rivers. Please read
                  the attached link from an article in
                  <a
